This is the repository containing all workshop materials for _Introduction to Rust Web Programming_.

## Overview

Rust, though often celebrated for its superior system-level programming capabilities, is rapidly gaining traction in the world of web development. Its promise of fast performance, minimal memory usage, instantaneous startup, and unparalleled memory/concurrency safety sets it apart from traditional web development languages. However, many are daunted by the perceived steep learning curve.

"Build Web Apps with Rust" is a workshop crafted specifically for individuals new to Rust. The aim is to bridge the gap between Rustâ€™s powerful potential and the practical realm of web applications. Dive into the world of Rust-based web apps, and learn how to leverage the unique features of Rust to build nimble and efficient web platforms. By the end of this course, participants will confidently be able to create basic CRUD applications, integrate persistent data storage, and seamlessly interact with cloud APIs using Rust.

## Who Should Attend

Developers intrigued by Rust and its potential for web application development, especially those with little to no experience in Rust. Whether you're a seasoned developer in other languages or just starting, this workshop is tailored to get you up and running.
Prerequisites

A basic understanding of web development concepts and practices. Familiarity with any programming language is beneficial, but not required.
